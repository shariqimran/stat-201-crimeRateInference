**Project Goal:** Formulate an Inferential Question and answer it using bootstrapping and hypothesis testing

## Introduction
This report aims to investigate whether the outbreak of COVID-19 has affected the crime rate, particularly with regard to assault and other offenses. We will analyze the crime data from two different timeslots, before and after the outbreak of COVID-19, and use statistical methods to identify any significant differences in the frequency of crime. By understanding the impact of COVID-19 on crime, law enforcement, and policymakers can develop effective strategies to keep communities safe.

In this project, we aim to answer the following question:

### Have *Offences Against a Person* been influenced by the outbreak of COVID-19?

We predict there to be significant fluctuation in *Offence Against a Person*.

## Discussion

### Recap

We found confidence intervals using bootstrapping, resampling the data, and conducting hypothesis testing which revealed that there is significant difference in the mean frequency of crime before and after the outbreak of COVID-19. Then we did the hypothesis test on comparing the frequency and obtaining the p-value for each test. These p-values support the assumption that the frequency of Offence Against a Person had a big fluctuation during the outbreak of COVID-19.

### Expectations

We expected to find significant changes in the frequency of crime following the outbreak of COVID-19. This is because the pandemic had led to unprecedented disruptions in daily life, including economic stress, social isolation, and increased substance abuse, which are all factors that could potentially drive changes in crime rates. Specifically, we expected to see an increase in crimes related to offences.

### Interpretation

After conducting our tests, our predictions were able to come true, we were able to reject the null hypothesis with there being significant fluctuations in Offence Against a Person with an average increase.t of the sport financially.

### Impact

Overall, our analysis underscores the urgent need for policymakers and law enforcement agencies to address the root causes of this increase in crime and develop strategies to mitigate the impact of the outbreak on community safety. Our study highlights the need for targeted crime prevention strategies to address the significant increase in certain types of crimes during the COVID-19 pandemic. Policymakers can use these findings to allocate resources effectively and develop evidence-based strategies to respond to and prevent crime during future pandemics or crisis situations.
